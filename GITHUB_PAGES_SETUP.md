# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide for Ishaan Dixit Portfolio

## Overview
Your portfolio is currently a full-stack application, but GitHub Pages only hosts static websites. Here's how to deploy it:

## Option 1: Static Build (Recommended)
Since your portfolio doesn't actually need a backend (it's just displaying your information), we can create a static version:

### Steps:
1. **Create a GitHub repository**
   - Go to github.com and create a new repository
   - Name it `ishaan-portfolio` or similar
   - Make it public

2. **Upload your files**
   - Download all files from this Replit project
   - Upload them to your GitHub repository

3. **Enable GitHub Pages**
   - Go to repository Settings → Pages
   - Select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Choose "main" branch and "/" (root) folder
   - Save

4. **Configure for static hosting**
   - Your site will be available at: `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name`

## Option 2: Use Netlify (Even Easier)
1. **Build your site**
   - Run the build command in this environment
   - Download the generated `dist` folder

2. **Deploy to Netlify**
   - Go to netlify.com
   - Drag and drop your `dist` folder
   - Get instant deployment with custom domain support

## Current Status
Your portfolio includes:
- ✅ Professional headshot

## Next Steps
1. Choose your preferred hosting method
2. Create your GitHub repository
3. Upload files
4. Configure GitHub Pages settings
5. Your portfolio will be live!
